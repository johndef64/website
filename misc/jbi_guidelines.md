Preliminary notes:

    Journal main topic: **Translational bioinformatics** 

    Translational bioinformatics papers are scientific articles that focus on the application of bioinformatics methods and tools to bridge the gap between biological research and clinical practice. These papers often involve the analysis and interpretation of large-scale biological data, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, with the aim of translating the findings into actionable insights for improving patient care, disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

    Translational bioinformatics papers may cover a wide range of topics, including:

        - Development and application of computational algorithms and tools for analyzing biological data.

        - Integration of multi-omics data to identify disease biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

        - Prediction models for disease prognosis, drug response, or treatment outcomes.

        - Data mining and machine learning approaches to extract knowledge from biomedical databases.

        - Computational drug discovery and repurposing studies.

        - Clinical decision support systems based on bioinformatics analysis.

        - Implementation of genomic medicine in clinical settings.

        - Studies on personalized medicine and precision oncology.

        - Bioinformatics approaches for identifying disease subtypes or patient stratification.

        - Validation and benchmarking of bioinformatics methods in clinical or translational research.

        - These papers contribute to the advancement of precision medicine by leveraging bioinformatics techniques to translate genomic and molecular information into improved patient care and clinical outcomes.

    Declaration of generative AI in scientific writing:

        The below guidance only refers to the writing process, and not to the use of AI tools to analyse and draw insights from data as part of the research process.

        Where authors use generative artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process, authors should only use these technologies to improve readability and language. Applying the technology should be done with human oversight and control, and authors should carefully review and edit the result, as AI can generate authoritative-sounding output that can be incorrect, incomplete or biased. AI and AI-assisted technologies should not be listed as an author or co-author, or be cited as an author. Authorship implies responsibilities and tasks that can only be attributed to and performed

        by humans, as outlined in Elsevier's AI policy for authors.

        Authors should disclose in their manuscript the use of AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process by following the instructions below. A statement will appear in the published work. Please note that authors are ultimately responsible and accountable for the contents of the work.

            Disclosure instructions:

            Authors must disclose the use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process by adding a statement at the end of their manuscript in the core manuscript file, before the References list. The statement should be placed in a new section entitled 'Declaration of Generative AI and AIassisted technologies in the writing process'.

                Statement: During the preparation of this work the author(s) used [NAME TOOL / SERVICE] in order to [REASON]. After using this tool/service, the author(s) reviewed and edited the content as needed and take(s) full responsibility for the content of the publication.

            This declaration does not apply to the use of basic tools for checking grammar, spelling, references etc. If there is nothing to disclose, there is no need to add a statement.

Focus Areas and Topics of Interest:

    JBI seeks to publish papers that make a conceptual contribution to the field, typically by describing  an innovation in methodology or technique or by discussing substantive generalizable lessons that  have been learned in the context of an informatics project. When a methodological contribution has  a theoretical basis, that theory is an appropriate emphasis for papers as well. Research papers may  also present a novel "method of methods" explaining how to apply the existing methods to a space 

    of biomedical problems that share unique characteristics influencing the choice of methods.

    JBI publishes papers on a wide range of informatics topics. However, across these topics, papers must build on deep understanding and utilization of medical domain knowledge and should consider pragmatic translation for clinical care or applications. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) clinical decision support, patient safety, natural language processing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, knowledge representation for healthcare, translational bioinformatics, clinical research informatics, and clinical informatics. Additional considerations for papers in the areas of translational bioinformatics, machine learning, security and privacy are provided below. Irrespective of the topic, papers must focus on novel informatics methods and its comparison to the current approaches.

    If you are considering an article with a focus on translational bioinformatics, please read this

    editorial. Biologic discoveries based on the use of routine informatics techniques may be important

    biologic contributions, but are not suitable for JBI. In addition, please note that JBI publishes

    bioinformatics papers only if they deal with issues in translational (human) science (e.g., translational

    bioinformatics papers).

    Papers are generally of seven types:

    Original research: Presentation and discussion of a biomedically or clinically motivated system or approach that has required the development of innovative methods rather than the application of established techniques. Motivating applications may be discussed, but the new method should be discussed so that generalizability is clear, ideally with an assessment of its range of applicability. Please choose the article type "Research Paper" during the submission process

    AUDIENCE: Biomedical informaticists, Health informaticists

GUIDE FOR AUTHORS

.

INTRODUCTION:

    The Journal of Biomedical Informatics (JBI) is the premier methodology journal in the field of biomedical informatics. JBI publishes research on new methodologies and techniques that have general applicability and form the basis for the evolving science of biomedical informatics. Papers should focus on a real-world biomedical or clinical problem, develop a novel approach to address the problem, and evaluate its appropriateness in comparison to the current state-of-the-art (SoA) methods. Involvement of healthcare professionals in motivating the work and evaluation of results is expected.

            Research, Special Communication, Methodological Review papers:

                Structured abstract (lesser or equal to 350 words, usual structure of Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusion). 6,000 words for the body of the manuscript (excluding abstract, references, appendices, figures and tables). Total of figures and tables = 8

PREPARATION:

        Please note that figures and tables should be embedded in the text as close as possible to where they are initially cited. It is also mandatory to upload separate graphic and table files as these will be required if your manuscript is accepted for publication.

    NEW SUBMISSIONS:

        References:

        There are no strict requirements on reference formatting at submission. References can be in any style or format as long as the style is consistent. Where applicable, author(s) name(s), journal title/ book title, chapter title/article title, year of publication, volume number/book chapter and the article number or pagination must be present. Use of DOI is highly encouraged. The reference style used by the journal will be applied to the accepted article by Elsevier at the proof stage. Note that missing data will be highlighted at proof stage for the author to correct.

        Formatting requirements:

        There are no strict formatting requirements but all manuscripts must contain the essential elements needed to convey your manuscript, for example Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Conclusions, Artwork and Tables with Captions.

        If your article includes any Videos and/or other Supplementary material, this should be included in your initial submission for peer review purposes.

        Divide the article into clearly defined sections.

        Figures and tables embedded in text:

        Please ensure the figures and the tables included in the single file are placed next to the relevant text in the manuscript, rather than at the bottom or the top of the file. The corresponding caption should be placed directly below the figure or table.

    REVISED SUBMISSIONS:

        Line spacing: 

        All revised submissions required 1.5 line spacing

        Use of word processing software:

        Regardless of the file format of the original submission, at revision you must provide us with an editable file of the entire article. Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. Most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. The electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the Guide to Publishing with Elsevier). See also the section on Electronic artwork.

        To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor.

        LaTeX:

        You are recommended to use the Elsevier article class elsarticle.cls to prepare your manuscript and BibTeX to generate your bibliography.

        Our LaTeX site has detailed submission instructions, templates and other information.

        Article structure:

            Subdivision - numbered sections

            Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections. Subsections should be numbered 1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), 1.2, etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering). Use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to 'the text'. Any subsection may be given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line.

            Introduction:

            State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results.

            Material and methods:

            Provide sufficient details to allow the work to be reproduced by an independent researcher. Methods that are already published should be summarized, and indicated by a reference. If quoting directly from a previously published method, use quotation marks and also cite the source. Any modifications to existing methods should also be described.

            Results:

            Results should be clear and concise.

            Discussion

            This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.

            Conclusions

            A short Conclusions section should follow the Discussion section. The Conclusions should present the main conclusions of the study and should clearly summarize the range of applicability of the methodology described in the article.

            Appendices

            If there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as A, B, etc. Formulae and equations in appendices should be given separate numbering: Eq. (A.1), Eq. (A.2), etc.; in a subsequent appendix, Eq. (B.1) and so on. Similarly for tables and figures: Table A.1; Fig. A.1, etc.

        Essential title page information:

            - Title: Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible.

            - Author names and affiliations: Please clearly indicate the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled. You can add your name between parentheses in your own script behind the English transliteration. Present the authors' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lowercase superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name and, if available, the e-mail address of each author.

            - Corresponding author: Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. This responsibility includes answering any future queries about Methodology and Materials. Ensure that the e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author.

            - Present/permanent address: If an author has moved since the work described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a 'Present address' (or 'Permanent address') may be indicated as a footnote to that author's name. The address at which the author actually did the work must be retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes.

        Structured Abstract:

            A concise and factual abstract is required, with a maximum of 350 words, and including Objective, Methods, Results, and Conclusion. The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, References should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself.

            Graphical Abstract:

            Authors must supply a graphical abstract for all types of articles at the time the paper is first submitted. The graphic should summarize the contents of the paper in a concise, pictorial form designed to capture the attention of a wide readership and for compilation of databases. Carefully drawn figures that serve to illustrate the theme of the paper are desired. The dimensions of the graphical abstract are 200 x 500 pixels. Authors must supply the graphic separately as an electronic file. Please refer the following link for details of graphical abstracts and their specifications: https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/graphical-abstract . For an example of a graphical abstract please click here.

        Keywords:

            Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 6 keywords, using American spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, 'and', 'of'). Be sparing with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords will be used for indexing purposes.

        Statement of significance:

            In the introduction, create a table using the following headings to summarize (in 100 words or less) the contribution of your paper to the existing literature:

            - Problem or Issue What is Already Known

            - What this Paper Adds

            Example of Statement of Significance:

            *Problem* Clinical trials' conclusions may not generalize to other patients.

            *What is Already Known* Although there have been many prior explorations comparing a trial sample with a potentially eligible cohort, a prominent limitation in these methods is that their comparisons are between different clinical settings or geographical locations.

            *What This Paper Adds* This study aims to build upon the prior generalizability assessment literature by controlling for clinical setting. Additionally, this study has a unique opportunity to address a potential temporality concern for generalizability assessments by focusing on when the trial was ongoing as opposed to when the trial was completed; this opportunity is worthwhile because it further ensures the patients are subject to the same treatment opportunities.

            Abbreviations:

            Define abbreviations that are not standard in this field in a footnote to be placed on the first page of the article. Such abbreviations that are unavoidable in the abstract must be defined at their first mention there, as well as in the footnote. Ensure consistency of abbreviations throughout the article.

            Acknowledgements:

            Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance

            or proof reading the article, etc.).

            Formatting of funding sources:

            List funding sources in this standard way to facilitate compliance to funder's requirements:

            Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [grant number zzzz]; and the United States Institutes of Peace [grant number aaaa]. 

            It is not necessary to include detailed descriptions on the program or type of grants and awards. When funding is from a block grant or other resources available to a university, college, or other research institution, submit the name of the institute or organization that provided the funding.

            If no funding has been provided for the research, it is recommended to include the following sentence:

            This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

            Math formulae:

            Please submit math equations as editable text and not as images. Present simple formulae in line with normal text where possible and use the solidus (/) instead of a horizontal line for small fractional terms, e.g., X/Y. In principle, variables are to be presented in italics. Powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. Number consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text).

            Footnotes:

            Footnotes should be used sparingly. Number them consecutively throughout the article. Many word processors build footnotes into the text, and this feature may be used. Should this not be the case, indicate the position of footnotes in the text and present the footnotes themselves separately at the end of the article.

            - Refer to equations as Eq. (3) or simply (3).

            - Punctuate equations to conform to their place in the sentence syntax.

        References:

            Citation in Text:

            - Ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice versa).

            - References cited in the abstract must be given in full.

            - Avoid including unpublished results and personal communications in the reference list, but mention them in the text.

            - If unpublished results or personal communications are included in the reference list, substitute the publication date with "Unpublished results" or "Personal communication".

            - Citing a reference as "in press" indicates that it has been accepted for publication.

            - Use the formal publication as the reference if a preprint has been published.

            - Clearly mark preprints as such by including the word "preprint" or the preprint server name in the reference.

            - Provide the preprint DOI.

            References in a Special Issue:

            - Add "this issue" to references and citations of other articles in the same Special Issue.

            Reference Management Software:

            - Many popular reference management software products have Elsevier journal templates available.

            - Ensure all field codes are removed before submitting the electronic manuscript.

            Reference Formatting:

            There are different ways to link your datasets to your article. When available, you can directly link your dataset to your article by providing the relevant information in the submission system. For more information, visit the database linking page.

            For supported data repositories a repository banner will automatically appear next to your published article on ScienceDirect.

            In addition, you can link to relevant data or entities through identifiers within the text of your manuscript, using the following format: Database: xxxx (e.g., TAIR: AT1G01020; CCDC: 734053; PDB: 1XFN).

         Research Elements:

            This journal enables you to publish research objects related to your original research -- such as data, methods, protocols, software and hardware -- as an additional paper in a Research Elements journal.

            Research Elements is a suite of peer-reviewed, open access journals which make your research objects findable, accessible and reusable. Articles place research objects into context by providing detailed descriptions of objects and their application, and linking to the associated original research articles.

            Research Elements articles can be prepared by you, or by one of your collaborators.

            During submission, you will be alerted to the opportunity to prepare and submit a manuscript to one of the Research Elements journals.

            More information can be found on the Research Elements page.

            Data statement:

            To foster transparency, we encourage you to state the availability of your data in your submission.

            This may be a requirement of your funding body or institution. If your data is unavailable to access or unsuitable to post, you will have the opportunity to indicate why during the submission process, for example by stating that the research data is confidential. The statement will appear with your published article on ScienceDirect. For more information, visit the Data Statement page.
