<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Clinical Significance: The patient carries pathogenic variants in SCN2A, SHANK3, PTEN, and a likely pathogenic variant in CNTNAP2. These genes have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and demonstrate a strong correlation with the patient's clinical presentation.<br>
    Variant Pathogenicity: The identified variants have been classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic based on their known association with ASD, functional impact on protein function, and prior reports in the scientific literature.<br>
    Relevance to Patient: The identified variants are likely contributing factors to the patient's severe autism phenotype, providing a genetic explanation for their condition.
</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Clinical Management: This genetic diagnosis may guide tailored interventions and therapies for the management of the patient's ASD. It is recommended to refer the patient to a medical geneticist for further evaluation and to discuss potential treatment and support options.<br>
    Genetic Counseling: It is suggested that the patient and their family receive genetic counseling to understand the implications of the genetic diagnosis. Further familial studies, including carrier testing and segregation analysis, may be recommended.<br>
    Research Opportunities: The results contribute to ongoing research efforts in autism genetics, potentially expanding our understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms and facilitating future therapeutic advancements.
