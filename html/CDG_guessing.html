  <h2>Case Presentation</h2>
  <p>We report the case of a French child of Caucasian descent. She was born at term with a length of 48 cm for 3.110 kg, after uncomplicated pregnancy with vaginal delivery. The AGPAR score was 10 both at 1 min and 5 min and the newborn screening results were normal. The parents are unrelated and the 6-year older brother is healthy. Parents reported abnormal abrupt movements of the child after birth that stopped spontaneously.</p>
  <p>Biologically, at 9 months of age, elevated transaminases TGO = 50 UI/ L, TGP = 51 [normal values 10–35 UI/ L] and normal coagulation parameters with ATIIIA = 63% [normal values 80–120%] and FXI 53% at the lower limit [normal values 50–150%] were assayed. The cytology and the thyroid function were normal.</p>
  <p>The clinical examination at 9 months of age revealed ataxia, hypotonia, hyperlaxity, strabismus, esotropia, feeding difficulties, and inverted nipples. The child was calm and exclusively breastfed with an absence of facial dysmorphia and no sleeping disorders. At that time, the girl presented an inability to reach a seated posture. There was an abnormal pattern in serum transferrin isoelectrofocusing [8] with an elevation of asialo- and disialo-transferrin. Brain MRI revealed cerebellar abnormalities with vermis hypoplasia. The child finally reaches a seated posture at 11 months of age.</p>

  <p>Based on the information provided, this case presents with several clinical features that may suggest a genetic disorder. The child's developmental delay, ataxia, hypotonia, hyperlaxity, strabismus, esotropia, feeding difficulties, inverted nipples, and cerebellar abnormalities on brain MRI are all concerning signs. The elevated transaminases and abnormal serum transferrin isoelectrofocusing also raise the suspicion of an underlying genetic condition.</p>
  <p>Given the variability and complexity of genetic diseases, it would be important to conduct further investigations to narrow down the potential diagnoses. Genetic testing, such as whole-exome sequencing or targeted panels, can help identify specific gene mutations or variations that may be associated with the observed symptoms.</p>
  <p>Additionally, considering the child's age at the time of presentation, it may be helpful to gather a detailed family history to assess for any inherited patterns or similar symptoms in close relatives. Consultation with a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor can aid in the diagnostic process by guiding the appropriate genetic testing strategy and interpreting the results.</p>

  <p>Possible Genetic Disease: Based on the clinical features and laboratory findings described, a few potential genetic diseases come to mind. One possibility could be a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG), specifically a type of CDG involving the N-glycosylation pathway. CDGs are a group of disorders characterized by abnormal protein glycosylation, leading to a wide range of symptoms and multisystem involvement. The abnormal transferrin isoelectric focusing and elevated transaminases can be indicative of a CDG.</p>
  <p>Another possibility is a cerebellar ataxia-related genetic disorder. The presence of ataxia, cerebellar abnormalities on brain MRI, and the delayed achievement of motor milestones suggest a potential genetic cause affecting cerebellar development or function.</p>
  <p>Further genetic testing, including whole-exome sequencing or targeted panels, can help identify specific gene mutations or variations associated with the observed symptoms. It is essential to involve a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor for a comprehensive evaluation and proper interpretation of the genetic testing results.</p>
  <p>Please note that these are educated guesses based on the information provided, and a definitive diagnosis would require further evaluation and testing.</p>
